## Introduction
Welcome to [Basic-web-app]! This project was built as part of my learning journey, following the comprehensive tutorials provided by the Mozilla Development Network (MDN) to master the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a practical application to reinforce learned concepts and experiment with different techniques in web development. The primary goal of this project is to solidify the knowledge gained through MDN's tutorials and provide a hands-on experience. As I navigated the intricacies of web development, this project became a canvas for experimenting with various techniques and functionalities.

## Features
- **Interactive Image**: Explore the dynamic nature of the web by clicking on the integrated image, triggering an engaging visual change.
- **User Interaction**: Engage with the app by providing your name. Experience how the web page dynamically adapts to personalize the user experience.
